## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Here is a list of my favorite iOS apps (no specific order):
- WhatsApp Messenger:
  - Status Posting Feature.
  - Voice Posting on Status Feature (New!).
  - Ability to see when messages were read.
- Youtube App:
  - The Searching Feature
  - The ability to have videos, likes, comments stored and being accessible to everyone
- Netflix App:
  - The ability to have multiple users with different preferences
  - The UI in general
  - Something most apps have, the login process (I would like to learn more about it)


- My Ideas of an App to Build:
  As I am just getting my hands on Mobile Development and more specifically on iOS development, I was thinking about something not too advanced. The idea would be to create a
  financial management app, where I could add different incomes I am getting, my savings and input several expenses that I may have. The app would be adding up my expenses and
  deducting that to the amount of money I have available and keep an updated count of the money I have available. If also possible, I could have a sort of an interactive graph
  that would break down different kinds of transactions and them up and display them by category. As of now, this what I am thinking could be a great app idea for me to work on.
  

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
The process was very straightforward. All of details were clear and I barely encountered any issues.
